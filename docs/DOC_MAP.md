## Decision Procedure — Which Doc to Read First?

```
START: I need to build / modify a feature
        │
        ▼
Does a Spec file exist for this domain?  (see Tier 2 below)
        │
       YES ──────────────────────────────► Read the domain Spec → PLAN
        │                                   If spec covers it: follow spec exactly.
        │                                   If spec doesn't cover it → go to NO path.
        │
        NO
        │
        ▼
Read SRS (docs/requirements/BanhCuon_SRS_v1.md)   ← WHAT the system must do
        │
        ▼
Read FSD (docs/requirements/BanhCuon_FSD_v1.md)   ← HOW each feature is designed to work
        │
        ▼
Still unclear? Read BRD (business context) and flag ❓ CLARIFY with user
```
